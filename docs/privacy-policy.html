    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">Pentangle &nbsp;·&nbsp; Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <p>
      Pentangle ("we", "us", or "our") is a social shelf-ranking app that lets you
      create ranked lists of your favourite music, movies, books, games, podcasts,
      and TV shows, and share them with people you follow. This Privacy Policy
      explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.
    </p>

    <hr class="divider" />

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p><strong>Account information.</strong> When you create an account we collect
    your email address, a username you choose, and optionally a display name and
    profile photo. If you sign in with Apple or Google, we receive only the
    information those services pass to us (typically an email address and display
    name).</p>

    <p><strong>Content you create.</strong> We store the shelf items (titles,
    categories, rankings, notes) you add, shelves you create, items you send to
    other users, and any profile bio you write.</p>

    <p><strong>Usage information.</strong> We collect standard app-usage data such
    as which features you use and when. We do not use third-party analytics
    SDKs.</p>

    <p><strong>Device information.</strong> Firebase, our backend provider,
    automatically records basic technical information (device type, iOS version,
    app version, crash logs) to help us maintain reliability.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>To provide and operate the app — creating shelves, ranking items, following
      other users, and sending items.</li>
      <li>To display your profile to users who visit it or search for you.</li>
      <li>To let you sign in securely via email/password, Apple Sign In, or
      Google Sign In.</li>
      <li>To store your profile photo (uploaded to Firebase Storage).</li>
      <li>To investigate reports of content that violates our guidelines.</li>
      <li>To fix bugs, improve performance, and develop new features.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We do not use your data to serve
    you targeted advertising.</p>

        results. We do not share user data with TMDB.

      </li>

        results. We do not share user data with Apple through this API.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>

    <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to any third party. We may
    share data only in the following limited circumstances:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>With other users.</strong> Your username, profile photo, bio, and
      public shelves are visible to other users of the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Service providers.</strong> We use Firebase (Google) to store and
      process your data on our behalf, under a data processing agreement.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal requirements.</strong> We may disclose information if required
      by law or to protect the rights and safety of our users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>

    <p>We retain your data for as long as your account is active. You can delete
    your account at any time from within the app (Settings → Delete Account), which
    permanently removes all of your personal information, shelf data, and uploaded
    photos from our systems.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>Pentangle is not directed at children under 13, and we do not knowingly
    collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child
    under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we
    can delete it.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>

    <p>Depending on where you live, you may have rights regarding your personal
    information, including the right to access, correct, or delete it. You can
    exercise these rights by:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Editing your profile directly in the app (username, bio, profile photo).</li>
      <li>Deleting your account from within the app to remove all stored data.</li>
      <li>Contacting us at the email address below for other requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>

    <p>We use industry-standard security measures including Firebase Authentication
    for credential management and Firebase Security Rules to restrict data access.
    No method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot
    guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will
    update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of
    Pentangle after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated
    policy.</p>
